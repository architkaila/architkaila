### Hi there 👋

I'm Archit, a Duke AI Master's graduate with a knack for turning complex problems into innovative, user-centric solutions. I am a "Deep and Narrow" engineer with 4 years of hands-on experience. I've had the privilege of driving AI adoption at Viatris, driving NLP solutions, and leading data science initiatives that have saved millions for businesses.

🔍 My expertise lies in PyTorch, TensorFlow, NLP, and Large Language Models like GPT / Falcon / LLaMa2. I've also got my hands dirty with AWS Sagemaker, Azure, and MLOps, ensuring that the solutions I build are not just smart but also scalable and robust.

🌱 I'm deeply committed to the transformative power of AI and ML, and I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that push the envelope. Let's connect and make technology work for us!

🍕 Feel free to reach out at [archit.kaila@gmail.com] for collaborations. I am always eager to discuss the latest happenings in AI, NLP, Computer Vision, and Large Language Models over a slice of pizza!
